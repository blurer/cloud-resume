Taken from this site and book - https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/ - which goes through the concepts of taking your plane-jane resume/cv and use GCP, AWS, etc cloud services. I opted to go the AWS route with everything hosted in S3, using CloudFront for CDN, route53 for DNS, and Certificate Manager for SSL. 

There are two componets for my implmentation, a startpage and the resume/cv itself.
